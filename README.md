An adiabatic fast passage calculator for ultra cold neutorns in field.

Note that there is an error, and the actual experiment being measured is TCN18-070. The SCM polarizer power measurement.
##To run:
python afp_UCN18-180.py -4 0

sys.argv[1] = -4 and is the vertical offset the neutron travels in a straight line
sys.argv[2] = 0 is the offset of the spinflipper away from mount point away from the analyzer foil
